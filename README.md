#neural-network-from-scratch
This repository contains the code for implementing a neural network from scratch using Python.

In this project, I aim to build a neural network from scratch in Python. The implementation will cover the 
fundamental components of a neural network, including layers, activation functions, loss functions, 
and optimization algorithms. I hope to gain a better understanding of the inner 
workings of neural networks.

This is a step by step project from educative.io page on "Your own neural network from scratch" course.
